Pipelines project

Learning how to build and use pipelines projects:

1. Import CSV file showing the price of the BTC in 5 mins timeframe.
2. Include an API to import raw new data (Bitstamp in my case).
3. Data engineering: Clean and obtain new variables.
4. Create different .py for every step:
    -Acquisition.
    -Data clean.
    -Analysis.
    -Join everything.
5. Make all the files to work together showing the last result at once.
6. Analyse strong movements
